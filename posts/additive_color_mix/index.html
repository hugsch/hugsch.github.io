		<p>In this journey, I will try to recreate the additive color mix diagram in Blender. As usual, there are several possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="1-three-colored-spotlights">1. Three colored spotlights</h2>
<p>The easiest solution is to create three spot lights. So, start Blender, delete the default cube and the light. Switch to top view; add three lights of type spotlight and a plane.</p>
<figure>

            <h4>Figure 1: Blender setup for the three colored spot-lights solution</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
<li>Switch to top view. This is not really essential but it makes your life much easier to get a spot light projection as a perfect circle.</li>
<li>Add three lights of type spot. Position them at location: Red (0, -0.25, 1), Green (-0.5, 0.5,1) and blue (0.5, 0.5, 1). Select the appropriate color and eventually Power (1000 W) and Spot Shape Size (75Â°).</li>
<li>Switch to render preview. Are the colored circles visible? NO, because there is no surface to &lsquo;shine&rsquo; on.</li>
<li>Add a plane at location (0,0,0) with the appropriate size. The colored circles become visible.</li>
<li>You need also to position the camera at location (0,0, 10) and change the view to camera view (Alt+Ctrl+0). Then you can render the image.</li>
</ol>
<figure>

            <h4>Figure 2: Evee render of setup from figure 1</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure 2 shows a nice additive color mix diagram. Note, however the status bar with extra info concerning the red color (obtained by Right-clicking on the red circle in the render preview).</p>
<h2 id="2-grease-pencil-layers">2. Grease Pencil layers</h2>
<p>Another solution is to use the 2D animation object Grease PenciL. You can create three 2D layers and draw a colored circle on it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete cube and light from the default scene, switch to top view and add a blank Grease Pencil object to the workspace.</li>
<li>Switch to the object data properties panel and add a layer to the grease pencil object. Remember you have created a blank grease pencil object.</li>
<li>Draw a circle on that layer and name the layer appropriately; e.g. circle-red.</li>
<li>Switch to edit mode, select all the points of the stroke (with the shortcut key L) and copy those points.</li>
<li>Create a new layer, give it a name and paste the copied points. Move the selection with the Grab tool.</li>
<li>Repeat step 5 for the third color.</li>
<li>Create three fill materials, select all the points from the first circle and assign a fill color to them. Repeat for the other two circles.</li>
<li>Note that (1) the last drawn circle will occlude the other two and (2) the colors look terrible.</li>
<li>Change the blend mode of the last two drawn circles from regular to Add to fix the occlusion problem. Add a sun light to the scene to get brighter colors. But once again, check the color intensities in render view and note thatthe intensities go way well over 1 (depending on the strength of your sun light).</li>
</ol>
