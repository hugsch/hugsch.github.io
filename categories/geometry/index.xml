      <description>FFMPEG is a command line tool for handling (decode, encode, convert, &amp;hellip;) video and audio files. It is used by many commercial and free software products, including Blender. The core is the FFMPEG program, together with a video &amp;amp; audio player (FFPLAY) and a stream analyzer (FFPROBE).
1. Generate testfiles Sometimes you need a test video or test image with a specific resolution, duration or framerate. You can first try with ffplay to view the test video.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Blender has five different color pickers? No? You can choose between them in the Preferences panel (Edit » Preferences » Interface). They look rather intuitive to use (see Figure 1). But even for this simple tool, several questions arise and trying to answer them will get you very fast into deep Blender space!  Why do we need 5 of them? Is it only a matter of preference?</description>
